# Bayesian Neural Network on classification

In this project, I attemted a task of binary classification and a task of multi-class classification based on clusters of points.

For the first task, I buit a simple network with one hidden layer.

Let's take a look at the posterior weights, tracked during training (for each of the 3 layers, 2 nodes each layer):

Comparing prior with posterior weights (posterior weight are in orange):
